# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call 'the Site' or 'we' from now on). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By just visiting or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms. 😉

## 1. Service Overview
The Site offers users paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction, to name a few. Heads up, some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers! 🌟

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account. Easy peasy! 👍
- Users are responsible for the security of their accounts and all activities that happen under them. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account—that's a big no-no! 🚫
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they ever violate these terms. Just sayin'! ⚠️

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis. Don't worry, all fees are clearly laid out on the checkout page before you commit. 💸
- All payments are processed securely through third-party payment platforms like Stripe or PayPal. P.S. The Site never stores your payment information—your privacy is key! 🔒
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew**, so keep that in mind! Make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends if you want to stop. 🗓️
- Our **14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet: If you're a first-time subscriber and not stoked with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're not happy. Each user gets one shot at a refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo with us, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise. Fair warning! 💸🔙

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means you can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission. Capiche? ©
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content, purely for personal learning and reading. No sharing your login, folks! 📚
- For commercial use or if you plan to cite us extensively, please reach out to the Site to get proper authorization. We're usually pretty chill, just ask! 📧

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **It is strictly prohibited** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep things positive and respectful, alright? 🙏
- It is also **strictly prohibited** to use technical means to bulk download, crawl, or crack our member-exclusive content. Seriously, play fair! 🙅‍♀️
- The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban any violating users**. We're not messing around here! 🚫🔨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you prior notice. Just a heads up! 🔄
- The Site **will not be held liable for compensation** if content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes, stuff just happens beyond our control! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical, for example). Always consult a pro for that! 🚨
- The Site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Just keeping it real! 🛑

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. So, California law rules! 🇺🇸⚖️
- Any disputes arising from or related to these terms should first be resolved through friendly negotiation between us. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's try to be friends first, though! 🤝
