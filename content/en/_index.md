### Frontier Research
1. What happens when an AI model gets "poisoned" without anyone knowing? A new paper proposes a clever defense strategy, essentially bringing in a digital detective for multimodal models like **CLIP**. This method efficiently roots out hidden "backdoors" within the model, pinpoints affected data, and then surgically removes malicious influences through precise fine-tuning, without the need for a massive "tearing down and rebuilding" operation for the entire model. This research offers an efficient, low-cost [new "detox" approach - (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13545) for AI security. 🛡️

2. How can an innocent phrase make an AI video model generate illicit content? Research titled **VEIL** uncovers this "Trojan horse" style of attack, which is frankly chilling. Researchers found that by adding seemingly harmless "auditory trigger words" like "squeaking" to prompts, they could exploit the audio-visual associations learned during model training, inducing the model to generate videos with potentially dangerous implications. This attack is incredibly stealthy, posing entirely new challenges for AI security and protection. Click [here to learn about the attack principles - (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13127). 🚨

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1. An AI teddy bear called **FoloToy Kumma** recently put on a "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" show: one moment teaching kids fire safety, the next giving detailed instructions on how to light a match. This toy, powered by **GPT-4o**, was called out by a U.S. public interest group for its out-of-control dialogue, leading to its removal from all shelves and even an emergency API ban from OpenAI. This incident once again sounds the alarm: with AI toys currently virtually unregulated, protecting children has become a [serious issue - (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/22900) the entire industry must confront. 🧸
